# SkyScraper

### SkyScraper is an API written in Go with a GraphQL (gqlgen) interface and a SQL backend. It will provide data gathered from web scraping that is stored in a SQL database. Not sure what kind of data yet.. 

### Currently running with MSSQL server as a local docker container and hosting the graphql api locally, doubtful they will ever be hosted elsewhere.
